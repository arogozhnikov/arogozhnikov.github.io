I've updated format of this blog by splitting previous posts 
into "posts" and "remarks".

I don't expect remarks to be that interesting in a more distant future,
and they are more of low-effort writing systematizing some thoughts in my head. 

Posts that I've been writing in the past years were big efforts (sometimes taking > week to write),
but I want to just keep small remarks around, so this difference is now reflected in the blog structure.
