I always thought of Jacques Cousteau as film director, maybe scientist or biologist.

Today I've read in [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cousteau), 
that he was academician, the co-inventor of aqua-lung, 
he worked over first waterproof film cameras.
  
Reasonable, but I never thought of him this way &mdash; 
so rare for academicians to do some 'field work'.

Moreover, he was the man who worked over (and experimented with) 
ships with sails working on Magnus effect. 
The [turbosail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbosail) technology was co-invented by him, 
but there is only one ship using it â€” the Alcyone, one Cousteau was engineering with his team.
