<div>Personally I am a big fan of <strong>numpy</strong> package, since it makes the code clean and still quite fast.<br/>
However I am much worried about the speed, so decided to collect different benchmarks<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>numpy</strong> vs <strong>cython</strong> vs <strong>weave</strong> (numpy is about 2 times slower than others)<br/>
(posted in 2011)<br/>

	<br/>
Primarily the post is about numba, the pairwise distances are computed with <strong>cython</strong>, <strong>numpy</strong>, <strong>numba</strong>.<br/>
	<strong>Numba</strong> is claimed to be the fastest, around 10 times faster than numpy.<br/>

	<br/>
	<strong>Julia</strong> is claimed by its developers to be very fast language.<br/>
Well, if that is true, there would be no need in writing easily-vectorizable operation in pure python (yep, I mean they are simply cheating), currently these 'benchmarks' are at the main page<br/>

	<br/>
The following post was written in 2011, the problem observed is solution of Laplace equation as usual.<br/>
Numpy is ~10 times slower than pure C++ solution (and equal to matlab), <strong>weave</strong> shows the speed comparable with pure C++ (I don't know anyone using weave now)<br/>

Fresh (2014) benchmark of different python tools, simple vectorized expression A*B-4.1*A &gt; 2.5*B is evaluated with <strong>numpy, cython, numba, numexpr, and parakeet</strong> (and two latest are the fastest - about 10 times less time than numpy, achieved by using multithreading with two cores)<br/>

	<br/>
Haven't found any general-purpose <strong>theano vs numpy </strong>benchmarks, but in the article there is comparison of neural networks and theano is expected to give much better speed than numpy/torch(c++)/matlab, specially it is fast on GPU<br/>

One more detailed review of numpy vs cython vs c (held in 2014)<br/>
	<a href="http://notes-on-cython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/std_dev.html">http://notes-on-cython.readthedocs.org/en/latest/std_dev.html</a><br/>
Let me copy-paste the example results (computation of std).<br/>
	<br/>
	<table class="comparison dataframe">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Method</th>
				<th>Time (ms)</th>
				<th>Compared to Python</th>
				<th>Compared to Numpy</th>

		<tbody>
			<tr>

Simple, but comprehensive comparison of python accelerators was prepared by Jake Vanderplaas and Olivier Grisel:<br/>

Problem is computation of pairwise distances. The results this time seem to be unbiased:<br/>
	<br/>
	<table class="comparison dataframe">
		<tbody>

				<td>Python</td>
				<td>9.51s</td>

			<tr>
				<td>Naive numpy</td>
				<td>64.7 ms</td>

			<tr>
				<td>Numba</td>
				<td>6.72ms</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Cython</td>
				<td>6.57ms</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Parakeet</td>
				<td>12.3 ms</td>

By the way, I was recently looking for a slow place in my code, and it totally dropped of my mind that <em>computation of residual is long operation</em>:<br/>
	<a href="http://embeddedgurus.com/stack-overflow/2011/02/efficient-c-tip-13-use-the-modulus-operator-with-caution/">http://embeddedgurus.com/stack-overflow/2011/02/efficient-c-tip-13-use-the-modulus-operator-with-caution/</a><br/>
Integer division / remainder computation time significaly depends on the bit depth (16 bit operation are ~2 times faster than 32 bit ones, division takes roughly 10 times more time than multiplication).<br/>
	<br/>
Surprising: multiplication/addition/binary operations take the same time (compared on numpy 1.9), which I personally find very strange (this behavior may be caused by quite complicated addressing in numpy arrays, which becomes the bottleneck, but this is only a guess).
