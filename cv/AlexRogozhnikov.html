    </p>

    <h2>Research</h2>

    <p>
        I develop algorithmic (and typically ML-based) solutions for the most important and intriguing problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        At Herophilus (biotech startup growing "brains-in-a-dish" called cerebral organoids)
        built pipelines and automated analysis of TL imaging, single-cell sequencing, IF organoid slices, ICC images, video imaging of neural activity and gene expression profiles. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Reworked tooling of data analysis team, developed models/approaches for vision in company, introduced an efficient and reliable algorithm to learn genotypes during demultiplexing in single-cell sequencing. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        At Intelligence Lab (Samsung Research) investigated various approaches to one-shot learning
        for face recognition on mobile devices.
        <br />
        Led development of neural text-to-speech synthesis, developed a data-efficient soft alignment of speech and text.
        <br />
        Also worked on object detection, active learning, and model conversion for production
    </p>

    <p>
        At Yandex/CERN developed ML approaches to different problems in high energy physics at the Large Hadron Collider.
        Developed machine learning-based approaches
        for particle identification, tracking, online data filtering, flavour tagging and particle shower detection.
    </p>
    <p>
        My methods were primarily developed for the LHCb experiment, but later spread across other CERN experiments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Previous research topics include optimal control, mathematical physics, and even solid state theory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Deep technical background helps in design of efficient algorithms and approaches,
        while wide experience allows dealing with non-trivial aspects of algorithms' existence-in-the-wild.
        And critical thinking is crucial to build proper validation.
    </p>


    <h2>Software development</h2>

    <p>
        Author and maintainer of <a href='https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops'>einops</a> tensor manipulations for deep learning.
        Einops is used in leading AI labs including FAIR, Google AI, Microsoft Research and Deepmind.
        Einops supports all major frameworks, including pytorch, tensorflow, jax and mxnet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wrote "<a href='https://github.com/arogozhnikov/python3_with_pleasure'>migrating to python 3 with pleasure</a>" back in 2018,
        which turned out to be rather impactful. Those days 'whether to migrate' was still a debated question.
    </p>

    <p>
        Authored and maintained multiple open-source packages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href='https://github.com/arogozhnikov/hep_ml'>hep_ml</a> (machine learning algorithms for high energy physics, widely used at CERN)</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
        Dozens of other smaller things, public and proprietary:
        research versioning, highly optimized number crunchers, ML competitions platform,
        and miniaturized deep learning models for cell phones.
    </p>
    <p>
        I maintain some of my projects with multiple users for >5 years, which shaped my mind on architecture, methodology, and choice of tooling.

        <summary>CAPE: Encoding Relative Positions with Continuous Augmented Positional Embeddings</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Transformers' attention mechanism is permutationally invariant (making "cat eats fish" and "fish eats cat" identical to transformers).
            </li>
            <li>
                Positional embedding is a common way to provide missing information about the order.
                We propose a simple yet extremely efficient and flexible strategy by augmenting encoded positions during training.
            </li>
            <li>
                We experimented with computer vision, speech recognition and machine translation to confirm better generalization and wide applicability of our method.
                Along the way we found that out method by design handles well different resolutions and stft sampling frequencies.

        <summary>Demultiplexer for single-cell RNA-sequencing</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_cell_sequencing">Single-cell transcriptome sequencing</a>
                - technique which employs next generation sequencing to estimate RNA content of individual cells.
            </li>
            <li>
                Multiplexing is a technique widely used to compare RNA profiles of different tissues (e.g. diseased vs healthy) within the same pipeline.
                Cells from different tissues (e.g. organoids) are pooled and then processed together.
            </li>
            <li>
                Demultiplexing is an inverse operation done computationally - by looking into resulting reads we try to guess which donor this cell could come from.
                Fortunately, everyone's genotype is unique (ok, almost everyone's) and these variations can be used by demultiplexing.
            </li>
            <li>
                My project is going further and learns genotype-specific polymorphisms from RNA-sequenced data to complement data known from
                <a href="https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/ogc/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/GSA-inputation-design-information.pdf">GSA</a>. <br />
                Resulting algorithm has ~4-5 times less error compared to demuxlet, which allowed to significantly increase a number of donors considered, which was critical in our case.

        <img src="images/BF-similarity.png" width="450" style="padding: 30px"/>
        <p>
            Developed a method to describe organoid morphology from brightfield imaging without manual labelling.
            Demonstrated its power by predicting gene expression levels from images as well as various visual phenotypes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Decomposed variability to contributing factors to guide following decisions on minimizing variability.
            Method is so sensitive it notices minor changes in protocol.

        <p>
            Building a system for face identification/verification based on deep learning.
            The system is optimized to run on mobile devices and to deal with few-shot learning scenario
            (i.e. very few training samples for each person).

        <summary>InfiniteBoost: building infinite ensembles with gradient descent (with T.Likhomanenko)</summary>
        <p>
            InfiniteBoost is a modification of gradient boosting that converges when a number of trees in the ensemble tends to infinity.
            In this approach, it is also possible to introduce automated tuning of capacity (it is a parameter that is similar
            to learning rate in gradient boosting).

        <summary>Particle identification at the LHCb (with D.Derkach, M.Hushchyn, T.Likhomanenko)</summary>
        <p>
            LHCb is one of four major experiments at the LHC, and it is a bit different from other experiments &mdash; LHCb is single
            arm, and analyzes particles in quite limited angle. However, the advantage of this scheme compared to other experiments,
            is that LHCb provides more information to identify particles, which makes it more precise in studies of b-physics.
        </p>
        <p>
            We prepared a major update of particle identification system with deep networks and GBDT. Important part was preparing models
            which are independent on momentum using an approach from "Boosting to uniformity" (see below).

        <summary>Finding electromagnetic showers in the OPERA </summary>
        <p>
            The OPERA is an experiment placed inside a mountain in Italy, it was created to confirm neutrino oscillations (Nobel prize
            2015). In this project I've created a system that detects electromagnetic showers in the data collected by the
            OPERA. That is, among millions of base tracks it finds a small pattern of ~ hundred base tracks.
            Needle-in-a-hay problem with tough computational requirements.

        <summary>Reweighting with Boosted Decision Trees</summary>
        <p>
            An important problem of many analyses in high energy physics is a discrepancy between simulated data and real data. An approach
            used previously to reduce this effect can only handle discrepancies in 1-2 variables.
        </p>
        <p>
            An algorithm was proposed that directly solves reweighting problem in many dimensions and additionally addresses some issues
            important for LHCb analyses, such as handling negative weights (so-called sWeights). This tool is used in LHCb
            analyses.

        <summary>Inclusive flavour tagging at the LHCb (with D.Derkach, T.Likhomanenko)</summary>
        <p>
            Guessing flavour of a neutral (non-charged) meson isn't easy, but required to estimate some of the standard model parameters.
            This information can be partially reconstructed by analyzing tracks left by other particles produced after collision.
        </p>
        <p>
            We came up with a simple probabilistic model which combines information from all the other tracks &mdash; and it works better
            than previous approaches, where separate analysis was performed for each type of tagging particles and for each
            meson.

        <p>
            Later I've tried to improve the system by including attention-like mechanism. This helps when amount of training data is
            limited.

        <summary>Boosting to uniformity (main author, with A. Bukva, V. Gligorov, A. Ustyuzhanin, and M. Williams)</summary>
        <p>
            Various statistical dependencies may be easy to use to improve classification, but are undesirable to influence our decisions
            (simplified examples are gender and race when using ML in hiring). Simply removing these features from training
            may not be sufficient, since other features may still have this information (e.g. photo in CV helps easily guess
            the gender, in some languages gender of a writer can be inferred from the text).
        </p>
        <p>
            We developed a method that is capable of suppressing dependency between classification result and one or more selected variables
            using specific loss (that is based on Cramer-von Mises criterion).
            <!-- Method is targeted at applications in high energy physics. -->

        <summary>Tracking in the COMET (with E. Gillies)</summary>
        <p>
            The COMET is an experiment in high energy physics currently under construction in Japan targeted at finding charged LFV transitions.
            The goal was to prepare a fast system that efficiently selects candidate events for transitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using machine learning coupled with a soft modification of Hough transform we were able to improve wire-level recognition
            quality: ROC AUC from 0.95 to 0.9993.

        <summary>Inclusive trigger for the LHCb (contributing author)</summary>
        <p>
            Millions of collisions should be analyzed each second at the LHCb experiment, which is an enormous amount of data (that can't
            even be stored), so the experiment uses online triggers that decide which collisions to store and which can be
            deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our team developed new trigger system based on MatrixNet (Yandex proprietary GBDT modification). I was responsible for speeding
            up the model and managed to compress an already trained MatrixNet ensemble from 10'000 trees to 100 without significant
            drop in quality.

        <summary>Optimal boundary control of oscillations in distributed systems (PhD thesis)</summary>
        <p>
            I was in a group led by Vladimir Il'in (<a href='https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ильин,_Владимир_Александрович'>wiki</a>)
            and investigated the problems of optimal boundary control of oscillations described by wave equation (exciting
            / damping of particular oscillations by actively interacting with a system at the boundary). Typical approaches
            investigate numerical algorithms to find an approximate solution, our group developed methods to solve the problem
            analytically, hence precisely and more efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've introduced a special notation based on operator matrices to describe the problem and provided optimal solution of control
            problem for composite rods/strings of multiple parts (previous results covered only very specific case with two
            parts and additional strong requirements).
        </p>
        <p>
            This research was selected as <strong>"best student's paper in mathematics"</strong> by Russian Academy of Sciences
            in 2012.

            This is a research in solid state theory: both dense loop model and spanning web model are lattice models (and have corresponding
