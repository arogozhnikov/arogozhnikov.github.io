<p>
    It's a bit mind-blowing when you want to understand it geometrically:
    <br/>we have vectors $x_1, \dots, x_n$ in n-dimensional space
    <br/>Let's take an  orthonormal basis in this space $e_1, \dots, e_n$ and compute such vectors obtained with via scalar product:
</p>
<p>
    $$z_i = (&lt;e_i, x_1&gt;, &lt;e_i, x_2&gt;, \dots, &lt;e_i, x_n&gt;) &nbsp;$$
</p>
<p>
    So the theorem is:
    $$ \det_{i,j} &lt;z_i, z_j&gt; = \det_{i,j} &lt;x_i, x_j&gt; &nbsp;$$
</p>
<p>
    And the proof is actually very simple, let's introduce the matrix $A$: $A_{ij} = &lt;x_i, e_j&gt; $
    $$ \det_{i,j} &lt;z_i, z_j&gt; = \det A^T A = \det A A^T &nbsp;= \det_{i,j} &lt;x_i, x_j&gt; &nbsp;$$
</p>
<p>
    Voila! Beautiful, but completely unclear.
