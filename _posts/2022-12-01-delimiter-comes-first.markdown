## Message 

- theoretical physics is not about studying things around us - 
and it is not about studying laws of nature,
it is about describing other possible worlds using only mathematical rules, studying these worlds.
And, maybe, finding one that looks like our world.


It is clear why this is possible in physics: physics is a consequence of fundamental laws.

However theoretical physicist stops at investigating main physical properties:
does it have stable particles? 
does it have any of the particles with characteristics analogous to what we know?
which new particles exist in this world?
is there gravity and other forces?
etc,etc,etc.

Strangely, this is the most productive way to understanding what our universe is - 
by hypothesizing what other worlds could be, and finding which ones are similar to the one we live in



Theoretical chemistry de facto exists


Why not biology?

we know about some way of life organization
But we certainly know that life changes over time
Can we try to guess what new organisms could be like

What if it was other planet? Would life develop like this?
Or if we seeded bacteria on other earth-like planet, what could it become?
In a bit more practical way - what are other microorganisms be?
