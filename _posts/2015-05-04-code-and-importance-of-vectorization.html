<p>That awkward moment, when the code written in matlab is easier to read and understand then tons os explanations: <br /><a href='http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/code/rbm.m'>Salakhudinov's code of RBM</a></p> <p>  This code IMHO is a good argument when you need to explain someone that he <b>really</b> needs to learn at least one language with vectorization, no matter whether it is R, matlab, or numpy or theano in python. </p>
